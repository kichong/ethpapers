Money Games II
In part 1, I wrote about what I believe money is. Why it matters and doesn’t matter.
In part 2, I want to explore how defining aspects of money games as finite or infinite can help calibrate decisions to be less wrong going forward. If a finite game gives you only two moves, then thinking about it from an infinite perspective should reveal a third move.
War Diaz
In their minds, the Diaz brothers almost never lose a fight even though their official records say otherwise. They are infinite fighters competing inside a finite game. The game they play is one where the objective is to break the will of the opponent. Force the other player to quit either voluntarily via submission or by force via loss of consciousness or catastrophic injury.
Since it’s extremely difficult to make either Nick or Nate Diaz quit, they rarely ever lose this version of the fight game. They simply run out of time.
Even though they play within the rules of legally-sanctioned MMA combat, if you believe what they say – if you believe they keep it real – then the game they play is beyond the official rule set.
Every fight is a continuation of an infinite game of will where the goal is to outlast your opponent, breaking them before they break you. This type of mentality cannot be maintained within the confines of time limits, rounds, and judge’s score cards. Losing via a judge’s decision is not the same as losing a real fight™.
If you rarely quit. If you rarely break. And if you can keep playing the game, you haven’t lost.
“There is but one infinite game.” - James P Carse
Your infinite game is singular and unique to you alone. It's a personal journey defined by the infinite player. The rules, the goals, the reason to play are defined by you. And playing this game is done for the sole purpose of continuing to play.
The infinite game is an RPG where you are the main character. On top of this meta game called life there are many smaller, more finite games.
The spectrum
According to James Carse: finite games are played to win; infinite games are played to keep playing.
From these two principles, we can derive a framework for finite and infinite games that is the basis for this writing.
What distinguishes the finite from the infinite game is the infinite cannot be controlled. It’s largely undefinable, unknowable, and uncertain. Infinite and finite games lie on a spectrum. The infinite side represents the uncontrollable. The side that we can never fully explain or comprehend. The spiritual. The Godly. The woo woo. The unexpected. Surprises live on the infinite side of the spectrum.
Standard physics has quantum physics, a land of mind-bending and non-deterministic possibilities. Finite games have infinite games. The rules of finite games are easy to measure while the rules of infinite games are hard to make sense of.
Finite games are more defined and deterministic. More certain, known, and predictable. More tangible and objective. Finite games have a known beginning and end. A predictable outcome. And specifically defined boundaries.
Infinite games focus on the process. Finite games focus on the outcome.
There are many finite games you are playing at one time. The infinite game is the one you play all the time.
The ETH money game
Boxing and jiu-jitsu, though they can be thought of as infinite games in themselves, are less infinite compared to MMA. The mechanical reason for this is: MMA has less rules so is more unpredictable. The same comparison can be made between Go and Chess. Go has less rules but more possible moves. Chess is the opposite.
Money games are all the types of finite games humans play with value, which includes investing, trading, and business.
The money game we are discussing here is most closely related to investing. Before crypto, money games like investing were played by people who had some kind of special privilege like already possessing a lot of money or having special certificates. Crypto is different because it lets everyone play the same game under the same rules. Everyone can see what the rules are and how they work. The ETH money game is inclusive, permissionless, and without boundaries.
Oversimplification is this writer’s game, and the laws of supply and demand are the best simplifications of the money game. Supply and demand are not iron-clad. They are bendable in many ways and based on social factors like legitimacy, but they are useful abstractions for playing the money game.
Buying and selling are finite game mechanics. If I sell, I create more supply. If I buy, I create more demand. Simple, deterministic cause and effect.
The ETH money game is made of one set of points: ETH; one action: conversion (buy or sell); and one rule set: time. Everything else is communication between players, which includes prices and narratives. In the finite game of ETH investing, the market and its prices show the score at one moment in time.
You play this game with everyone who holds or wants to hold your asset. The goal of the ETH money game is to hold more ETH. Buy means converting something else to ETH. Sell means converting ETH to something else (like USD or DAI). Holding can be thought of as a passive or defensive position. Buying and selling are specifically defined actions at specific points in time.
Investing as an infinite game has no end. The whole point is to keep playing. It is even possible to pass on the game to others after you die.
We will look at ETH investing from both the finite and infinite sides of the spectrum.
Finding a rhythm
In a finite game, you can tell if the game has been won or lost. In an infinite game, you can’t. The main difference between finite and infinite games is time. Time is a boundary in finite games. In more infinite games, time is unpredictable and extending your time in the game is the whole point.
The series of decisions for each player can be broken down to buy, sell, or hold. A buy initiates a holding period, which ends in a sell. Each of these sets of decisions – beginning with buy and ending in sell – can be thought of as a finite game in itself because there is a well-defined beginning and end.
There are two possible gameplans or strategies here: buy and hold; or buy and sell. Every move other than holding initiates a new sequence of events where new decisions must be made. The simplest strategies as explained by Warren Buffet and Howard Marks are about not selling because selling adds complexity. If your plan is to buy and hold, you’ve limited the possible moves and decisions, and made the game more finite – more predictable – and in theory, more winnable.
However, buy and hold only works if you have income or positive cash flow or else you risk becoming a forced seller. This is a simpler strategy in the context of the investing game but relies on playing other games like cash flow or income generation. I know this now, but I wish I figured this out a lot sooner.
The market has a rhythm. Events tend to recur. Players tend to repeat certain actions depending on the situation and timing. Time spent playing any game allows us to become more aware of these rhythms.
One way to become better at money games is to examine our history and choose strategies that compensate for our tendencies and corrects recurring mistakes.
10 years in the game
The following is not meant to be taken seriously or for anyone else to follow. It's simply a message to a naive kid from a slightly less naïve, older kid. It’s what I wish I would’ve known. Really, this whole thing is just a reflection of lessons learned.
You, my friend, are recklessly enthusiastic. You’ve made a lot of money but lost more of it than you needed to.
It seems you thought you were playing one game (buy and hold investing) but you lacked the foundations (consistent and reliable cash flow) to play properly so in reality you were playing another game (buy, hold, and forced selling). You were leaking money on a wild ride and instead of fixing the leak, you were YOLOing the whole way.
The same factors that contributed to the rise also contributed to the fall: highly optimistic risk taking, big leaps of faith, and the assumption of going up forever without protecting the downside.

The best part of the last decade playing the money game was developing a writing practice as the ultimate compounding investment. Writing not only to express what I think but as a process to figure out what I think.
Using infinite and finite games as a framework, you realize that infinite game strategies run underneath and in parallel to all the finite game strategies. Finite skills are specific to the game. Infinite skills apply everywhere.
In the infinite game, time is an arrow pointing in one direction. In finite games, time is bounded within a set beginning and end.
|------|-----------|-----|-------------------------|------------------ >
Time allows us to set up decisions and actions in the future. In other words, future actions are set up by circumstances created by past decisions. Buying, selling, or holding are downstream from decisions we’ve made in the past. Because the future is unpredictable and we can’t really know how our actions will play out, the best we can do is practice finding the rhythm of both the markets and our own tendencies.
If we accept that investing is a finite game in the Carse sense, then there are many dimensions that we can already win before play even beings. The ideal is to set a plan which makes winning inevitable.
Only time will tell if this works.
Surviving cycles
The infinite game is about survival. If you never game-over yourself, and you keep learning and adapting, then eventually you will reach the long game. A black belt is a white belt who never quit.
In practical terms, surviving means sustaining your will and resources (credit: Simon Sinek) for as long as possible. The money game happens in cycles where the price peaks, then crashes, then peaks, then does it again and again. The same thing happens to your will and resources.
Cycles are like rounds. If you survived the last round, you get a reset. You can regroup. Take a breath. Then get back in. In any field the most legit people are the OGs. OGs survive, learn the lessons that need to be learned, and go on to the next round. Next match. Next game.
Compared to will, resources are easily definable and measurable. Will is on infinite side of the spectrum, intangible. You can run out of resources – as I have 3 times since 2014 – but if your will endures, you can still play the game.
When traders draw lines on price charts, there is always one line that is lower than all the rest. This line is where they believe the bottom is, where they think the price can go no lower until it does. After that line, the pain begins. The world begins to end when you draw a new line lower than the last line and think no way it happens again yet quickly it does and it’s at this point you realize that you fucked up.
All the hype and self-talk is easy at the start, but everyone has a breaking point. The longer it goes on, the more people discover theirs where you thought you were tougher than your body allowed you to be. The point where you must decide to stop or gut it out. To always go beyond your maximum pain point is stupid because pain has a purpose. It’s a message to stop and live to fight another day or it’s a step to building endurance. It’s impossible to always know the right answer, but either way, it’s a lesson to be learned and the more you feel it, the better you understand it.
Pain teaches us how much we can take. It humbles us. Then we learn that pain does, eventually, end. The memory is stored in our body. We become less fragile, more resilient. We become proud because we know we survived and afterwards is never as bad as during. We laugh about it. We tell stories. We share our pain with others.
These cycles of ups and downs are where you learn the tacit skills that can’t be easily explained or taught. Surviving is an iterative process. Survival is an infinite skill.
Greed and fear
Understand that money games are mostly about human emotions. It’s both an internal game with your own psychology and a multi-player game with the manic-depressive masses.
Sustaining your will and resources depends on balancing fear and greed. Greed at the right time increases your possible reward. Fear at the right time helps you keep it.
The game would be easy if we could all simply "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful” as the sage advice goes. But like so many aphorisms that sound simple, following through is really hard. It expects us to know the feelings of the masses and be disciplined and courageous enough ourselves to go against the trend.
I find it easiest to buy when others are fearful because my conviction and greed levels are elevated by default. I’m recklessly optimistic. But I find it hardest to sell when others are greedy for the same reasons.
The fear, greed, and human element of the money game mean we never know what is going to happen because players including ourselves do not always act rationally. It’s like the weather. It’s like the waves. It’s like the seasons. We can kind of tell what’s going to happen, but we never know exactly. A good barometer for your own fear and greed is whether you can sleep at night. If you can’t, then you’re off-balance.
In money games, the balance isn’t between buying or selling, it’s between greed and fear. Don’t trust yourself to predict the future or control your emotions. It’s impossible. Instead, create a process. Find a way to learn from your mistakes and do better next time. Every person is different so each process is different, but if you can understand what is legit and why, your own fear and greed, how to survive and adapt long enough to keep playing, then, in theory, if all goes well, and you get lucky, you’re gonna make it.
Even though this game is hard and unpredictable, and at times, painful, what could be better than a game that never ends and can never be perfected. A ruthlessly fair competition where even failing can inspire others. It’s like the fight game or the writing game. It’s a mirror that shows you exactly who you are. No excuses. No one to blame. Everyone a critic.
It’s a hard thing to put yourself out there but it’s harder to know you never stepped into the arena. When in doubt, always remember the most timeless sage advice ever spoken by man: “Don’t be scared, homie.”

Money Games
I want to reduce my understanding of money to the absolute essentials.
The plan is to use excessive simplifications to create a mental gameboard of pieces, rules, and points or goals. Nuance and strategies can then be applied on top of the simplified framework.
Money is commonly understood as something valuable that other people want to own. It is usually represented as a number. The money or point system we use depends on the era and community we live in. The goal of most players is to maximize their points and win all the benefits, status, and glory that comes with victory. How the game is played depends on how the rules and points are defined.
The players can be individuals or collectives. They can choose to cooperate or compete.
What changes from money game to money game are the points, rules, and players. Switching out the parameters changes the game but leaves a root truth intact – and the root truth of money is a competition over scarcity. We evolved in a world of scarcity and still live on a planet with limited resources, so humans have an instinctual respect for scarcity. Even in the digital world, we recreate scarcity in the form of attention (likes and views), authority (blue checkmarks), or simply limiting the numbers of available units (NFTs and ETH or BTC).
Why money matters
Money will never go away entirely because it’s useful. It is a story we tell ourselves about what we want and it’s a way to easily compare different things.
Money helps people who wouldn’t normally trust each or have any way of communicating share an understanding of what is valuable. Go to any market in the world and without speaking the language, it is possible to get a meal if you have the money the seller wants. This can be done with trade and barter, but money makes the transaction smoother. It’s a common language and just like language, it’s largely arbitrary. Also like language, it has profound effects on how we see and behave in the world.
We value what is difficult to obtain and we value what other people want. That will never change. It is why money will always matter even if it looks very different between eras. Instead of fighting this pattern, we should embrace money’s quality as a stand-in for scarcity and limited resources. What should be fought is any system that is unjust, unfair, and involuntary.
Money in its purest form reminds humans that we can’t control everything. Like nature, money doesn’t care about our feelings.
The free market is all the money games people play – all the transactions – combined into one giant scoreboard with the same point system. The scoreboard reflects the metrics or statistics people want to extract from the state of play between players at a given time.
Collectively playing the money game can help us determine what is valuable. The free market – when truly free – is uncontrollable and can offer useful signals and information for society in a way that is impossible to predict.
At the opposite end of the pure money game is complete centralized control. A planned economy. These economies tend to fail. It has not been possible to effectively plan and dictate peer-to-peer transactions. Perhaps you can in the future, but it hasn’t been possible in the past.
Money also acts as a hedge against violence. If a game is simply an interaction between two or more players, then the most brutal game is war. There needs to be no shared understanding or agreement in war. The only objective is to take. Take resources, take lives, inflict damage and suffering on your opponent(s). War is the game with the highest stakes.
The current money game has legitimate qualities. It was born out of a reshuffling of world powers in the 1940s and led to a relatively stable, peaceful, and prosperous period. Though never perfect, games of politics, money, and even sports give humans an outlet for war. Competing over made-up points releases the tension that can build up when different tribes of apes are forced to live next to each other. Money can be a good thing.
99% bullshit
The earth is physically limited and money has acted as a symbol for what we simply cannot replicate to infinity (store of value). With money, we can trade using a commonly understood system of points (medium of exchange). And we can easily communicate how much we value something (unit of account). But as our reality becomes more digital – more digitally abundant – money and scarcity can take new forms: ETH, NFTs, ERC-20s, etc.
As scarcity becomes more obviously an abstraction, it also becomes more of two things:
A circle jerk
An open experiment
Money has the highly reflexive or mimetic quality where if more people want the thing, the more value it has, so more people want it. Thirstiness rises as FOMO and YOLO mentality start to dominate until the last buyer is spent. When the climax happens, it’s a mess. The bigger the circle, the bigger the mess. This is often referred to as a bull market and crash. What was once wanted by all is now wanted by practically no one and the trend goes in the opposite direction.
Money is not all a joke, but it’s a more of a joke than most people want to believe.
James P. Carse defines finite games as being played to win and infinite games as being played to continue playing. Money is a finite game on top of an infinite game. The infinite game contains an enduring thread of truth while the finite games are mostly bullshit.
The problem with money is the current system – the institution of money – that we have now, which is at its core deeply coercive. Players are born into the game and forced to play with massive advantages or disadvantages. Between certain countries, the discrepancies are obscene.
The current system is oriented toward the short term. The goal is to win the game by maximizing your points even if that means poisoning our planet; imprisoning and ostracizing those who don’t want to play; forcing people to work demeaning jobs; or optimizing sadistic algorithms to capture our attention and piss us off.
“Evil is not the inclusion of finite games in an infinite game, but the restriction of all play to one or another finite game.” - James P. Carse
Legit money
Humans have used many types of money over the years. We’ve played different versions of the money game. Why should we believe we’ve discovered the perfect one? The last one? One way to look at Ethereum is simply as an evolution of these games.
Ethereum is an open experiment which allows for every possible type of finite game on top of it – all connected to the base root that no one controls. Everyone on the internet can access the new money game. New waves of people can create money games that suit their own needs and interests.
People can try variations of planned economies. People can volunteer to participate in as many experiments as they want until they get it right. It may turn out that socialism works, but only as niche economies on top of certain free market conditions. Ethereum lets us test out the idea. It may turn out that some versions of planned economies can work and work well.
The expansiveness of the system allows for endless experimentation. A paradox: Ethereum allows for an infinite number of ways to play with scarcity.
Open public blockchains like Ethereum show people what money is made of – the guts and bones of it. After some questioning and learning, most people reach the conclusion that money is a story about legitimacy and trust.
If belief creates money, then we can make new types of money using a shared layer of trust and consensus: the thing blockchains are good at. Ethereum solidifies legitimacy as shared software with a common database. It opens games of legitimacy, which includes money games, to a wider audience of both players and game makers.
The existence of a different money game exposes the current one as absurd because they are both absurd. NFTs are great at showing the subversive power of absurdity.
Ethereum represents a new board with new rules. There is one base layer of the game, which guarantees everyone plays by the same rules. On top of the base, any variation of arbitrary status game is possible.
Money is not that serious. It’s made-up points for a made-up game. The difference now is we can see the rules more clearly. And more people are becoming aware the game is anything we collectively agree to. In these decentralized and permissionless systems, we can volunteer to participate and choose which games we want to play. Only those who want to enter the arena engage in the competition. Everyone else should be spared with no consequences. If this money games sounds better than the one we have, then the next step is to collectively migrate value and legitimacy from one system to the next. The process is not orderly, but it can be done peacefully.
Ethereum is not magic. It’s just a first step in what will hopefully be better forms of money. We don’t know what those forms of money will look like because the point is not to arrive at a destination but to move the game forward. The point is to keep everyone in the game.

ETH is Matter
The first cryptocurrency was created over a decade ago. We still don’t know what to call the universe that originated from it.
Blockchain explains how the technology works: transactions are grouped into blocks, then linked together creating a long chain of provable history. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has fallen out of favor, but it attempted to define what blockchains do: create a decentralized record owned by a wide variety of entities. Cryptocurrency was the first intended application (bitcoin) of a blockchain. Web3 signifies the technology as the next phase of the internet. But what is the “metaverse”? Why did a science fiction term get appropriated by what started as money enabled by cryptography?
To a cynic, the “metaverse” is a buzz word. A meaningless narrative pushed forward by venture capitalists. There is validity to this point of view: the metaverse is mostly an empty space filled with hopes and dreams. But it’s also a space only possible because of breakthroughs in mathematics. And if you believe as Wittgenstein did that “our universe is as big as our language”, then new words like metaverse may be a genuine attempt to expand the limits of our understanding.
The word metaverse was first introduced in the 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson: “He’s in a computer-generated universe that his computer is drawing onto his goggles and pumping into his earphones. In the lingo, this imaginary place is known as the Metaverse.”
Today’s metaverse is far from the immersive virtual reality imagined by Stephenson. Dog tokens and ape pictures are only a rudimentary form of what is possible, but it hints at something bigger. Instead of a hyper-immersive simulation optimized to emulate physical sensations, we are getting a place with shared, objective rules for scarcity, which perhaps unexpectedly, feels very tangible.
In its cryptography-powered form, the word metaverse seems to mean a place that is somehow both digital and solid.
A simulated universe
In the physical universe, there is one set of universal laws (physics) everyone must follow and there exists objective stuff (matter). As social animals, these properties are reinforced by the fact that we occupy the universe with other people who share the same general perception of reality. The more widely this reality is experienced among our fleshy peers, the more tangible, legitimate, and solid the universe will feel.
I define the metaverse as having two properties:
Immutable laws like the laws of physics in the “real” universe. In other words, there are no sources of omnipotent power.
A limited substance acting as digital matter. In other words, the metaverse contains objective, convertible scarcity.
If we were to build a simulated universe right now, doing it together would be the only way to get started. Ethereum has, by far, coordinated the most diverse and enduring set of computers and minds around a single shared state of virtual reality containing both immutable laws and digital matter.
Most online platforms have centralized sources of power, which can easily change the foundational rules of their systems. Ethereum creates a system in which power is intended to be widely distributed and rules are enforced by cryptography. Unilaterally changing a decentralized protocol is hard. Until proven otherwise, there exist no omnipotent powers capable of changing the laws of the physical universe – and the metaverse should reflect this property.
If this premise of the metaverse is to be believed, then the Ethereum protocol is the metaverse, and ETH is its matter.
As a hard-to-define technology, analogies from biology, history, economics, and politics are commonly used when trying to explain blockchains. Blockchains are like emergent organisms. Blockchains are a technological breakthrough on the same scale as the printing press and ledger during the Renaissance. Blockchains enable digital nations with their own laws, citizens, and economic systems.
The intention here is to explore Ethereum as an engine to create a simulated universe, which can contain or connect to a multitude of other simulated universes, which in its entirety, create the metaverse.
ETH is matter
In the digital world, a constrained amount of digital material became possible in 2009 when the Bitcoin network’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism created provable digital scarcity – hard points – but scarcity is not enough to create a metaverse. You must be able to convert one form of scarcity or tangible, objective, “hard” substance into another. And you must be able to convert it within the rules of the universe (something Bitcoin can’t do.)
In Ethereum, the fundamental rules of the system are expressed in the consensus and execution layers. In simplified, abstracted, and non-technical terms, the laws of consensus determine truth on the blockchain: what happened and when. The laws of execution determine how things can change: what is allowed to become true in the future. Each change in the state of Ethereum is measured in blocks, which can be viewed as the constant tick of accumulated events moving time forward in the metaverse. Together, consensus, execution, and blocks create the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a distributed global computer capable of creating and connecting to additional virtual machines.
Within the Ethereum Virtual Machine, smart contracts allow us to manipulate matter (ETH) and build enduring structures. Smart contracts are how new worlds get built.
Initial coin offerings (ICOs), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and nearly all other meaningful activity involving blockchains has happened in Ethereum. Collectively, these waves of usage can be seen as small steps in the evolution of the digital substance known as ether or ETH. ICOs naively converted ETH into new tokens. DeFi laid down the foundations for how ETH could be converted into other digital substances without ever needing to leave the Ethereum Virtual Machine. NFTs explore how ETH can be changed into unique forms of scarcity. Each wave made the metaverse more solid, more richly textured.
The next wave of the metaverse is already moving beyond the financial realm as we begin exploring how non-transferable “soulbound” tokens, decentralized societies, and privacy preserving ZK identities can allow us to rethink who we are and how we express our connection to others.
Action is energy
When we speak, our voice changes the arrangement of matter in the air. When we think, our brain generates chemical and electrical activity changing the state of matter in our synapses. The state of matter in the physical world changes as we move, interact, and think.
Transactions or on-chain actions are how we as humans interact with the metaverse. Our transactions in the blockchain are like our actions in the physical universe: it’s how we move and change the state of the world.
In financial terms, each transaction incurs a fee which must be paid for in ETH. Matter is valuable and for simplicity’s sake, we often think of it as money. Money is easily measured and conceptualized using a familiar frame of reference, but just as physical matter can be much more than money, digital matter can be much more than digital money.
In metaverse terms, each transaction only happens when ETH is converted into an action. This digital matter can be converted to pure action (sending ETH between people), a different type of matter (fungible and non-fungible tokens) or creating new rules (launching smart contracts). If the state of matter did not change, then the metaverse does not record a change.
In the metaverse, ETH is matter and action is energy.
Rethinking everything
Ethereum is being built to last centuries and we are now at only the most nascent stages of the experiment.
To consider the full potential of the metaverse, we must stretch our imaginations beyond the span of our lifetimes. If we make it far enough as a species and civilization, we can assume there will be breakthroughs in quantum computing, cryptography, and artificial intelligence – all of which would turn our current metaverse into something only recognizable in science fiction.
We may reach the point where we can create hyper-immersive artificial universes and populate them with conscious artificial intelligence. We can imagine a multitude of universes, worlds, and dimensions all connected to each other and all populated with different varieties of conscious beings.
For us to reach this sci-fi future, the first priority is survival, which is increasingly called into question by the crumbling of our social norms, institutions, and environment. As our social cohesion and planet continue unraveling, Ethereum offers a new tool in which we can design experiments around coordination and learn new ways to collectively organize ourselves. Besides the fact people may simply enjoy hopping in and out of multiple digital realities using alternative digital identities, a simulated universe opens up new frontiers for exploring our humanity.
An experimental world within the metaverse could contain scarce resources that emulate, for example, fish in a lake, a forest, or clean air. As provably scarce resources, they could be tied to financial value in the “real” world. How much will people compete or cooperate for these valuable resources? What parameters make people compete until the resource is depleted? Are there certain rules we can put in place to maximize the chances participants will collectively sustain or even regenerate the scarce resources of their environment? Can we reorient financial incentives toward the public good?
By building virtual versions of our connections and environments from scratch, we can question how we organize ourselves, then design experiments to test our assumptions with live participants and real scarcity. We can take the lessons learned from our digital worlds and apply them to our physical reality.
Ethereum is not the answer to all the world’s problems. Neither is the metaverse. They are tools to help us better understand and organize ourselves. They may also be fun.
By starting from the very foundation of the universe, it is possible to rethink nearly everything. The creation of scarcity from mathematical principles is a vital step, but it is only the first, small step. As we explore the world with these new tools, we will undoubtedly reconsider our most enduring beliefs and assumptions. This messy period will have unintended consequences, but chaos also creates opportunity for rebirth and renewal.
We do not know how the metaverse will change us or where it will take us, but along the way, it will almost certainly make us more self-aware and maybe that’s what it takes to get us to a future we all want.

This is version 2 of ETH is Matter. Version 1 is here:

Ethereum Papers
“Whole civilizations rise from stories – and can rise from nothing else.”
James P. Carse¹
The Ethereum whitepaper² was the first story. In 2014, it laid out a vision for the decentralized world millions now spend countless hours exploring, building, or thinking about. Ethereum Papers are an attempt to continue the tradition of using words to build worlds – to clarify and reason about a place that doesn’t exist yet.
Like the protocol itself, Ethereum Papers have no ultimate destination. We play for Team Ethereum where the goal is not to win, but to keep playing. Admittedly, it’s an unusual game. Its inventors have no control over it, and no one knows how or when it will end. We only know that anyone can play the game, the rules are the same for everyone, and the game changes as it is played.
The overall narrative of blockchains, crypto, web3, or whatever term people make up in the future is being shaped now and Ethereum Papers intend to play some small role in this process.
Being understood
The Federalist Papers made the case for the U.S. Constitution – a major change in how a young nation was to be governed. Ethereum Papers make the case for Ethereum: exploring why the protocol matters and how it might serve as the foundation of our collective digital universe. Those who don’t like this idea should start the Anti-Ethereum Papers.
“...the ratification of the United States Constitution which, while quite elaborate, was primarily elaborate in the redundancy with which it applied the principle of checks and balances of power. Thus most citizens only read one or a few of The Federalist Papers that explained and defended the Constitution, and yet got a reasonable sense for what was going on.” -Vitalik Buterin³
Ethereum can be thought of as a new version of the internet, one where the power to dominate others is minimized. Though this network is believed to be built on technological foundations strong enough to defend itself, the technology alone is cannot create a system that is both widely used and widely trusted. Only legitimacy⁴ achieves that.
The world of crypto is full of jargon. New ideas and concepts require new words, but new words can also intimidate and confuse – intentionally or not. Understanding enhances legitimacy and to be understood means communicating in a language people can relate to.
Effective advocates invite and welcome. Whether in the form of essays, poems, and songs, or novels and graphic novels, the aim is to write in a way that people can understand, in a language they are familiar with, and in stories they can relate to.
The negative stories that have painted the ecosystem so far have been effective at gaining attention and creating doubt, but this technology is intended for centuries not years. We plan, build, and think for the long-term. Fleeting attention will always follow mimetic cycles of euphoria and despair, but deep understanding – and the conviction that comes from it – must take its time. It can only be earned through patience and resilience.
A new medium
Ethereum is its own world with its own rules. NFTs are objects in that world.
In the years to come: NFTs may die out as a passing fad, the Ethereum network may be replaced by a completely different blockchain, or a global catastrophe may render all these technologies pointless. We are on the frontier of a rapidly changing digital world and every promising medium for storytelling, creativity, and expression that becomes unlocked from this shifting landscape is a path worth exploring.
NFTs allow writers, and other creatives, to have complete ownership of their work. Writers have the freedom to create first drafts, special editions, and as many versions and iterations of their work as they see fit. This creates a new class of creator and a new class of audience. Instead of simply being a consumer, the audience becomes a collector, investor, advocate, speculator, and consumer all at once. The writer and audience co-create a world in which they mutually benefit; they both become incentivized with the same goal: to spread the word.
“Humanity is a curious species. Every once in a while, somebody gets a good idea. Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements. Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed. Some of these devices – calculators, thermometers, microscopes, and the glass vials that the chemists use to boil and distil liquids – serve to make it easier to generate and try out new ideas, including ideas that expedite the process of idea-generation.” -Nick Bostrom⁵
If Ethereum is a protocol on which new ideas can be built and tested, the intention of Ethereum Papers as NFTs is to expedite the process.
History and permanence
The blockchain creates a living record of events – one that can be trusted to be true because the rules are built on a practically unbreakable system of mathematics called cryptography. This history of events, which can’t be faked or corrupted means every NFT, and every idea represented by an NFT, is its own source of truth. As an NFT, ideas and stories are solidified on the blockchain.
What was said, when and by whom becomes part of the public record. If the record cannot lie and is always visible, then the record itself and our interpretation of it, becomes a source of legitimacy that is powerful in ways we are just beginning to understand. At the very least, the simple existence of the record gives us a single shared objective reality.
Permanence can be thought of as the expectation that the state of objects, players, and rules of the world will continue as is. If history is based on the past – that the past happened, and it happened this way – then permanence is the belief that the record will continue to be written according to the same rules.
For a system to be legitimate, we must have some faith in its permanence. Otherwise, why would anyone waste their time? We cannot know for certain, but we fully expect U.S. dollars to have worth tomorrow. So too do some of us expect Ethereum to be around in 100 years.
Objects on the blockchain need the expectation of permanence. Creators and collectors alike must have faith that the canvas they are using will extend into the future – long enough for their creation to grow in value, whether that value be financial, cultural, or personal.
Every medium shapes what is written on it. Writing on paper is different from writing in sand, which is different from carving words into stone. For those with faith in the protocol’s continued existence, the expectation of permanence makes writing on Ethereum like carving words into digital stone.
Why Ethereum?
Blockchains are about how humans come to agreement about what is true; how to reach consensus. Because these systems can hold and express power, how consensus is achieved become social and political questions.
Decentralization is about how broad, diverse, and numerous are the people who reach consensus on a blockchain. The more prolific and boundless are a people, the harder they are to control and manipulate – the same is true for blockchains. A decentralized blockchain is a robust one. It is harder to corrupt and harder to destroy. Being resistant to corruption allows for a more trustworthy history while being difficult to destroy guarantees more longevity.
A more decentralized blockchain is more legitimate.
Decentralization is not simply a technical factor. It is a cultural aspiration closely linked to neutrality, fairness, equality, and transparency. Judgments about legitimacy and decentralization are subjective and human, which could be argued makes them the most important factors. Blockchains are something humans do as a collective, and humans beings are collectively subjective.
Why Ethereum? Technically, it has the most numerous and diverse maintainers⁶, builders⁷, and users⁸. Subjectively, the Ethereum community has a culture that aspires to be decentralized. Decentralization is not only a moral and philosophical aspiration, but a practical one, one more likely to guarantee a trusted history, permanence, and ultimately legitimacy.
Ethereum Papers are about inviting people to a new world – a new way of doing things. It reflects a community’s ideas and aspirations. We’re not exactly sure where we’re going, but we do know the more people that join us, the better this new world will be.
Consider this your invitation.
